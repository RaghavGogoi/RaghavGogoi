# More Details
I am a deeply creative and introspective person, drawn to exploring the vast possibilities of art and technology. My passions include drawing, gaming, programming, 3D modeling, VFX designing, and music production. These interests allow me to express my imagination, blending visual art with technical precision to bring ideas to life.

I dream of becoming a game producer and web developer, where I can channel my skills into creating immersive experiences and innovative designs. However, my aspirations are fluid, constantly evolving as I discover new fields and challenges. This flexibility fuels my growth and keeps me engaged in a journey of endless learning.

I cherish my solitude and the peace it brings. I keep very few, but deeply meaningful friendships, valuing quality over quantity in relationships. While I enjoy my time alone, it’s not a retreat but a choice to remain true to myself.

Being exactly who I am is something I take pride in, and I find joy in building, creating, and exploring at my own pace. I embrace my unique path with confidence and curiosity, always striving to push boundaries and discover what’s possible.
